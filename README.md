### Professional Experience

Throughout my journey as a Software Engineer, I have had the opportunity to work in various industries and contribute to a range of impactful projects, primarily using C++ and other technologies like Java, Qt, and MySQL. Each experience has allowed me to deepen my understanding of software engineering, from desktop and mobile application development to backend systems and automation solutions.

In one project, I developed a product focused on automating price updates for business documents. This project resulted in a 10% reduction in company expenses and a significant boost in productivity. Additionally, I built an intuitive application for monitoring and assigning tasks to employees, which streamlined internal processes and enhanced overall work efficiency. This project allowed me to apply my C++ and Qt skills in a real-world environment, demonstrating the value of automation in business operations.

In another experience, I was immersed in the world of embedded development and mobile systems, where I worked on both **AOSP (Android Open Source Project)** and vendor-specific products. My role involved contributing to the creation and refinement of key features while working closely with cross-functional teams. I participated in design discussions and collaborated on implementing new functionality, focusing on improving the stability and reliability of the systems. Through detailed analysis and debugging, I helped ensure a seamless user experience. My work with technologies like **C++, Java, and Android SDK/NDK** gave me a deeper understanding of both software and hardware integration, a crucial aspect of embedded systems.

I also supported a dynamic project aimed at managing mobile facilities, including trucks and cars. One of my major contributions was leading the migration of the application to more modern technologies, which ensured its scalability and readiness for future growth. I also developed new functionality based on client requests and optimized technical processes, which enhanced operational efficiency. This experience solidified my skills in using **C++ (with Boost) and C++Builder** for creating robust solutions tailored to the transportation industry.

Additionally, I gained valuable experience in full-cycle software development through my work as a **C++ Developer**. I was responsible for developing user-friendly interfaces using **Qt**, implementing database interactions with **MySQL and Firebase**, and ensuring seamless data management. Collaborating closely with stakeholders, I gathered requirements to deliver practical and efficient solutions. I also actively participated in code reviews and worked alongside the team to ensure that we followed best practices throughout the development lifecycle.
